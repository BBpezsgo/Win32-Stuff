  <remarks>

      <c>WriteConsoleInput</c> places input records into the input buffer behind any pending events in the buffer. The input buffer grows dynamically, if necessary, to hold as many events as are written.

      This function uses either Unicode characters or 8-bit characters from the console's current code page. The console's code page defaults initially to the system's OEM code page. To change the console's code page, use the <see cref="SetConsoleCP"/> or <see cref="SetConsoleOutputCP"/> functions. Legacy consumers may also use the chcp or mode con cp select= commands, but it is not recommended for new development.
